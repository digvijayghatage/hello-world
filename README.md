Why Use Bootstrap?

Advantages of Bootstrap:

    Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap
    Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
    Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap 3, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
    Browser compatibility: Bootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera)

Where to Get Bootstrap?

There are two ways to start using Bootstrap on your own web site.

You can:

    Download Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com
    Include Bootstrap from a CDN

Downloading Bootstrap

If you want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, go to getbootstrap.com, and follow the instructions there.
Bootstrap CDN

If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

MaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery:
MaxCDN:
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- jQuery library -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

<!-- Latest compiled JavaScript -->
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

One advantage of using the Bootstrap CDN:
Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap from MaxCDN when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.
